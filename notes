Gloria vs. hamlet executor
 WHICH CASES WILL GLORIA WIN

1. Implementation

    1.1 Optimizer
        SEQ pattern (✔︎)
            - single Flow
            - multiple Flow

        Kleene pattern(✔︎)
            - single kleene
            - nested kleene

    1.2 workload generator/analyzer (✔︎)
        workload generator:
            3 types of mini workload, each has 20 queries
                SEQ   X, A, B, Y
                Single cycle   X,(A, B)+,Y
                nested cycle  X, (C, (A, B)+, D)+, Y

        workload analyzer:
            take in the workload file and analyze into mini workloads
            for each mini workload: template-> graph construction-> find optimal path



    1.3 Executor
      predecessor, snapshot, snapshot expressions

        select the datasets, probably the same with hamlet

    1.3 baselines
        MCEP? variations of Gloria
        SEQ WITH SHARON
        KLEENE WITH HAMLET

2. Paper Writing
    section 3: sequential edge optimization(✔︎)
        how s-sets are decided from preceding edge
        reuse/local snapshot operations
        cost models

    section 4: Gloria Graph model (✔︎)
        use seq as examples
        graph construction
        pruning
        optimal path searching

    section 6: kleene patterns


    section 2.5 Gloria in a Nutshell
    intro: related work, contribution.
